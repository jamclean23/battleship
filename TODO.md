TO DO---------------------
-Report which ship was sunk on the transition screen.
-Fleet status/Radar buttons need to be darker color when selected.
-Fix on mobile: current functionality allows user to see pass the modal by dragging up in certain scenarios.
-Disable buttons while while sleeping between turns.
-Legend for different ship types.
-Commit button turn green when valid placement, red when not. Or preview/selected squares change color.
  Will need a separate function to check for placement validity before committing placement.
-Improve Ai.
